Q.1- What is an access token? Generate your access token for any 
API.(for example Twitter,Spotify etc).

An access token is an object that describes the security context of a 
process or thread. The information in a token includes the identity and 
privileges of the user account associated with the process or thread. 
When a user logs on, the system verifies the user's password by 
comparing it with information stored in a security database. If the 
password is authenticated, the system produces an access token. Every 
process executed on behalf of this user has a copy of this access token.

The system uses an access token to identify the user when a thread 
interacts with a securable object or tries to perform a system task that 
requires privileges. Access tokens contain the following information:

The security identifier (SID) for the user's account
SIDs for the groups of which the user is a member
A logon SID that identifies the current logon session
A list of the privileges held by either the user or the user's groups
An owner SID
The SID for the primary group
The default DACL that the system uses when the user creates a 
securable object * without specifying a security descriptor
The source of the access token
Whether the token is a primary or impersonation token
An optional list of restricting SIDs
Current impersonation levels
Other statistics


// GENERATING ACCESS TOKEN FOR FACEBOOK API, USING FOLLOWING STEPS:

open facebook developers>>> tools>>>graph API explorer

click on get Access Token>> select permissions >> click on get access 
token

login when askded for >> copy the access token

Q.2- Get the IP address of some common sites like Google, Facebook by 
using DNS lookup.

google.com: 216.58.196.206
facebook.com: 157.240.13.35
acadview.com: 52.37.66.135
github.com: 192.30.253.112



Q.3- What is a difference between library and API . Figure it out with 
examples.

A Library is a chunk of code that you can call from your own code, to 
help you do things more quickly/easily. 
For example, a Bitmap Processing library will provide facilities for 
loading and manipulating bitmap images, saving you having to write all 
that code for yourself.A library performs specific, well-defined 
operations.

An API (application programming interface) is a term meaning the 
functions/methods in a library that you can call to ask it to do things 
for you - the interface to the library.
An API is an interface for other programs to interact with your program 
without having direct access.
A web API is collection of web urls which is a bridge between two 
applications.

Example:  Scrapy is a library in Python. If you are involved in 
webscraping then this is a must have library for you.

Example:  NumPy is a library in Python. It provides some advance math 
functionalities to python.

Example: OLA using Google Maps API for navigation

Example : Amazon : Online Shopping for Electronics, Apparel, Computers, 
Books, DVDs & more released its API so that Web site developers could 
more easily access Amazon's product information. Using the Amazon API, a 
third party Web site can post direct links to Amazon products with 
updated prices and an option to "buy now."
